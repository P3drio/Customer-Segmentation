# Customer-Segmentation

This project demonstrates my skills and proficiency in data analysis using Python. The code provided performs various operations on a dataset using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Code Structure
The code can be divided into the following sections:

Data Loading and Exploration: The code imports the necessary libraries and loads the dataset using Pandas. It performs initial exploratory data analysis by displaying the first few rows of the dataset, showing data types of each column, and checking for missing values.

Gender Analysis: The code separates the dataset into two subsets based on gender (male and female). It calculates the mean annual income and spending score for each gender and displays the results.

Data Visualization: The code generates various charts to visualize the distribution and relationships between variables. This includes distribution plots, scatter plots, violin plots, and swarm plots.

Clustering Analysis: The code performs clustering analysis using the K-means algorithm on two different sets of variables: age and spending score, and annual income and spending score. It determines the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and visualizes the results with 2D scatter plots.

## Results
The data analysis code provides insights into the dataset, including gender-based analysis, data visualizations, and clustering analysis. The visualizations help understand the distribution and relationships between variables, while the clustering analysis identifies distinct clusters based on selected variables.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance the analysis or apply it to different datasets. For any questions or inquiries, please contact me at [pedrimate@gmail.com].
